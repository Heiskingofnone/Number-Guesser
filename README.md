# Number-Guesser
My first project since i started learning C++, this is a number gueser game with levels of difficulty that determines number of tries. Lets see how it goes!!!
*After exploring and applying what little skills i learnt
i was successful in making this game that generates a random number and compares it to the user's input and gives a feed back if they have won or have gone over or under the random number
all in all i had fun and I am still exploring as a beginner!!
Thamk you!
